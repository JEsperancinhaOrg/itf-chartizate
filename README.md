## Description

This is an image to char coder, with a spin off to the current available ones
ITF comes from image train filters and the idea is to use this library in many other projects. However the idea was to create a train of filters where each wagon would transform the image. It should work much like the chain of responsibility pattern.

#### Deprecated

The following are libraries available in JFrog. I am not maintaining them anymore because of the major refactoring I had to do to support my other project [Image train filters](https://github.com/jesperancinha/image-train-filters-scala). You can find the releases in this repo and also in JFrog. The coming versions will be more stable and though out to the general public.
